### **Wireframes**

Wireframes were created using [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/). These were initial rough ideas of the site structure and layout.

### **Database**

I used [Lucid chart](https://lucidchart.com/pages/) to create a data flow diagram showing what an authorized and non-authorized user had access to throughout the site. I have also shown below my custom models for User, Post, Like and Comment.

### **Color Scheme**

Main colours used throughout are listed below. I came across the blue color previously and liked it a lot. I used a basic light grey and white background to go with the blue in some areas, to make a clean and simple design. I prefer less colours as it can begin to look unorganised if too many are used.
